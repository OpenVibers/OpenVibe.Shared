# Changelog

All notable changes to `openvibe-shared`. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org/): a
breaking change to any exported module, browser global or served file name is a new major.
A release is the git tag `vX.Y.Z`; consumers pin the tag's tarball (see README).

## 1.2.0 — 2026-09-23

- `navbar.js` loads `release-watch.js` (from the same place it was loaded from) four seconds after
  `init()`, so every site on the shared navbar gets release prompts once it serves `/release.json`.
  A site without the route costs one 404 per page load; `init({ releaseWatch: false })` opts out.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-09-23

- `release-watch.js` works without the `<meta name="ov-release">` tag: the release `/release.json`
  reports when the script loads becomes the page's baseline, and a site that serves no
  `/release.json` is asked once and left alone. Adopting it is a route plus one script tag.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-23

Active-client update safety (ADR-016, contract `registry.release-manifest@1`). Additive only.

- `openvibe-shared/release` (server): `createRelease({ service })` → `handler` for
  `GET /release.json` (deployed commit, commit time, package versions, `MIN_CLIENT_RELEASE`,
  24 h mixed-version window) and `metaTag()` for the page's own release.
- `release-watch.js` (browser, served at `/shared/release-watch.js`): on focus, visibility,
  reconnect and every 10 minutes, compares the page's release with `/release.json`. A newer
  release shows one Reload toast; a required release or one older than the window reloads the tab
  only when it is hidden or idle, no text field has focus and nothing is protected
  (`form[data-dirty="true"]`, `[data-ov-protected]`, `window.OVProtected()`).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-22

First release from its own repository. Imported history-free from
`OpenVibe.Network/packages/openvibe-shared` at Network commit `f337eb6`; every module is
byte-identical to that commit except `navbar.js`, which only changed as listed below.
Vendored copies in Media, Tools and Community carried a stale `ov-icons.js` (and Community a
stale navbar test); canonical was correct everywhere — see `docs/divergence-2026-09-22.md`.

### Changed
- **navbar.js no longer ships every glyph.** The 87 Font Awesome solid glyph paths moved to a new
  browser file, `nav-icons.js`. navbar.js keeps the 13 glyphs it draws itself (account menu,
  admin link, wallet chip) plus the widths of the rest, and fetches `nav-icons.js?v=<content hash>`
  once, after first paint, the first time a site's link, chip or menu row names another glyph —
  from the directory navbar.js was loaded from, else `https://openvibe.network/shared/`. The slot
  is an empty `<svg>` of the glyph's exact size until the path arrives, so nothing moves; the
  finished DOM and pixels are identical to the Network copy (checked in headless Chrome). If
  `nav-icons.js` cannot load, those icons fall back to `<i class="fa-solid …">` (the behaviour
  before inline glyphs). A page that loads `nav-icons.js` before navbar.js gets every glyph
  synchronously. New option: `iconsUrl`.
  navbar.js: 151.8 KB raw / 39.0 KB brotli → 118.6 KB / 27.6 KB.
- `scripts/build-nav-icons.py` now writes `nav-icons.js`; `scripts/build-navbar-icons.js`
  regenerates navbar.js's block from it (`--check` in the tests).

### Added
- `files.js` (`require('openvibe-shared/files')`): the list of browser files a site may serve at
  `/shared/<file>`, the package directory, `isBrowserFile()` and `path()`.
- `exports` for every module (`openvibe-shared/navbar`, `/nav-icons`, `/theme-loader`, … and
  `/package.json`); every subpath the Network copy exported still resolves to the same file.
- Tests: `test/run.js`, a navbar.js size budget (29 KB brotli) and icon availability test,
  browser-bundle hygiene (no `require()` or Node globals in served files), package exports.
- `scripts/size-report.js`: raw and brotli (q11) size of every browser file.
- CI on Node 22.22.1, including an install of a tag-style tarball into an empty project.
